To me spoiler tags are just common courtesy and, in the instance of Pottermore or any other new canon, should be utilized :) Oh, and thank you for clarifying."

  <row Id="952" PostId="424" Text="@gilles I think that all of these match the description in the FAQ, so if I was forced to adhere to that, I would delete all of these.  I think several types of &quot;lists&quot; were conflated in the summary question (as mentioned in the comments there) and so the definition we have excludes too much.  However, I could be in the minority in feeling that, so if that's the case, I argue that we need to be fair and delete all of these too, since they are the same type of question, but without the tag."

It was reached part by consensus and part by compromise. My aim here is to make the site match the guideline. Note that I'm calling it a guideline, not a rule — it's more of a default rule. Maybe we'll end up keeping 5, or 10, or 20 of these — but they'll have to be either miscategorized, or exceptionally good questions, worth keeping even though they're technically off-topic."

The problem with questions that seem to invite a list of answers is that it turns out to be very hard to get people *not* to add an answer because they thought of one example that may or may not have been mentioned in another answer. In other words, list questions tend to become pseudo-polls even if the asker wasn't deliberately aiming for that. This has been true on SFF.SE and on other SE sites before that."
