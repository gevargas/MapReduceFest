But think of Pixar's Incredibles when Mr. Incredible wanted a cape for his costume-- something prevalent for the super-hero mythology. That's interesting because it's quite broad. I consider manga characters with big appetites interesting for the same reason. It's always a main character, and most likely the main hero of the story that has such a characteristic.
